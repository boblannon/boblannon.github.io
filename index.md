## About

I'm a software developer with a background in natural language processing, statistics, and machine learning. I've contributed my data science skills to introduce real, pragmatic solutions to difficult problems in data processing and analysis. I also have experience performing exploratory data mining and creating interactive visualizations. I have developed and maintained data-intensive web apps, and have also pursued novel methods of acquiring and mining new data.

My passion is designing & building conduits of information. The goal is to make complex data available to experts who are researching it. Hopefully, this in turn empowers them to reach and educate non-experts.
